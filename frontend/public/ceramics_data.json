            "article_context": "Josiah Wedgwood recorded how Alice later died very suddenly at church one Sunday night in 1772. [...] Whieldon's Account Book provides much information for his business during the period 1749 to 1762 and from 1754 to 1759 when he was in partnership with Josiah Wedgwood, but beyond that there is little documentary evidence of his family or his life save for the normal run of parish records and occasional mentions in the private correspondence of Josiah Wedgwood and others. [...] He died in 1795, surviving his former partner Josiah Wedgwood by just a few weeks, and was buried in the parish church of Stoke-upon-Trent . [...] From 1754 to 1759 Whieldon enjoyed a partnership with the young Josiah Wedgwood . [...] Thomas Whieldon was recognised by his contemporaries as one of the most successful potters in Britain and one author has suggested that, aside from Wedgwood's family members who were already established in business, \"there was probably no one who could have taught him so much about the innovative techniques that were already changing an ancient craft into a substantial industry.\" [...] Other writers have pointed to a possible lack of innovation, on the contrary: according to Brian Dolan, Whieldon's production appears to have altered little between 1759, when Wedgwood left him, and 1780 when he retired. [...] Robin Hildyard has said, less generously, that Whieldon lacked creative ambition and \"was content to mass-produce unadventurous wares for general consumption\", providing Wedgwood only with \"an object-lesson in how to acquire wealth with a minimum of risk.\" [...] Thomas Whieldon took Josiah Wedgwood into partnership at his factory at Fenton Vivian in 1754. [...] By then Whieldon was 35 years old and had already achieved financial success and a considerable reputation whilst Wedgwood was just 24 years old; Whieldon had clearly recognised his great potential. [...] Whieldon's pottery production is described by Josiah Wedgwood in his contemporary Experiment Book where there is a wealth of manuscript material on the partnership. [...] Here Wedgwood explains that by 1759 there was an urgent need to improve the quality of lead-glazed creamware which was the principle ware being produced by Whieldon at the time. [...] It is likely that Wedgwood's work with Whieldon was largely experimental and concerned with improving the factory's wares and looking to the future. [...] This set Wedgwood on a course of experimentation that lead on to his future fame. [...] Wedgwood was brought into partnership to address these problems and was mainly engaged in improving the lead glazes for creamware . [...] By 1759, when Wedgwood decided to leave and set up his own independent business, he had already made his first successful experimental glazes. [...] Even after Wedgwood had established his own business, he continued to buy-in wares from Whieldon, usually biscuitware for later decoration and glazing, to meet demand, when needed. [...] Archaeological excavations at the Fenton Vivian site conducted by Arnold Mountford on behalf of Stoke City Museum between 1968 and 1970 found evidence of salt-glazed stoneware, tortoiseshell ware, agateware, red stoneware, glazed red earthenware, blackware and a small amount of plain creamware, all dating from the time of Whieldon's partnership with Wedgwood. [...] In his Experiment Book, Josiah Wedgwood states that in 1759 tortoiseshell ware was the second most important ware at the Whieldon factory, but the market was declining: \u201c But as no improvement had been made in this branch for several years, the country was grown weary of it; and though the price had been lowered from time to time, in order to increase the sale, the expedient did not answer, and something new was wanted, to give a little spirit to the business.\" [...] Later, Josiah Wedgwood took up the idea of a community for his workforce at the Etruria works when he founded the village of Etruria in 1769, consisting of 42 dwellings and an inn. [...] Whieldon, Spode and Wedgwood were amongst those who subscribed to the first turnpike roads in the neighbourhood. [...] Josiah Wedgwood went on to revolutionise transportation within the Potteries by commissioning the first canals from 1766. [...] The Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Staffordshire holds the only known portrait of Thomas Whieldon."

[...] Many of Julian's decorations were patterns adopted from ancient vessels of the Pueblos. [...] Maria and Julian's oldest works were all unsigned. [...] Even though Julian decorated the pots, only Maria claimed the work since pottery was still considered a woman's job in the Pueblo. [...] Maria left Julian's signature off the pieces to respect the Pueblo culture until 1925. [...] After that, \"Marie + Julian\" remained the official signature on all of the pottery until Julian's death in 1943.

[...] Later, financial struggles led them back to France, where Gauguin received formal education. [...] The financial crisis of 1882 significantly impacted his brokerage career, prompting a full-time shift to painting. [...] Gauguin's art education was largely self-taught and informal, shaped significantly by his associations with other artists rather than academic training . [...] His work in Brittany and Martinique showcased his inclination towards depicting native life and landscapes. [...] By the 1890s, Gauguin's art took a significant turn during his time in Tahiti, then a French colony, where he sought a refuge from the Western civilization, driven by the colonialist tropes of exoticism prevalent at the time. [...] Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. [...] His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. [...] Paul Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was the illegitimate daughter of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Laisnay and Don Mariano de Tristan Moscoso. [...] Details of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's family background are not known; Don Mariano came from an aristocratic Spanish family from the Peruvian city of Arequipa . [...] This never materialized; but she successfully published a popular travelogue of her experiences in Peru which launched her literary career in 1838. [...] In 1850, Clovis Gauguin departed for Peru with his wife Aline and young children in hopes of continuing his journalistic career under the auspices of his wife's South American relations. [...] Gauguin's idyllic childhood ended abruptly when his family mentors fell from political power during Peruvian civil conflicts in 1854. [...] After attending a couple of local schools, Gauguin was sent to the prestigious Catholic boarding school Petit S\u00e9minaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin . [...] His mother died on 7 July 1867, but he did not learn of it for several months until a letter from his sister Marie caught up with him in India. [...] He became a successful Parisian businessman and remained one for the next 11 years. [...] By 1884, Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he pursued a business career as a tarpaulin salesman. [...] Mette became the chief breadwinner, giving French lessons to trainee diplomats. [...] He returned to Paris in 1885, after his wife and her family asked him to leave because he had renounced the values they shared. [...] ] Gauguin's last physical contact with them was in 1891, and Mette eventually broke with him decisively in 1894. [...] In 1873, around the time he became a stockbroker, Gauguin began painting in his free time. [...] Nearby were the caf\u00e9s frequented by the Impressionists. [...] The following two summers, he painted with Pissarro and occasionally Paul C\u00e9zanne . [...] He was attracted in the first place because it was cheap to live there. [...] He mainly painted landscapes such as La Berg\u00e8re Bretonne (\"The Breton Shepherdess\"), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. [...] The naive drawings of the English illustrator Randolph Caldecott, used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the avant-garde student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls. [...] The most important of these is Four Breton Women, which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott's illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature. [...] The bold use of pure colour and Symbolist choice of subject matter distinguish what is now called the Pont-Aven School . [...] By contrast, the art of Africa and Asia seemed to him full of mystic symbolism and vigour. [...] In such works Gauguin paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of colour, thereby dispensing with the two most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting. [...] During this time, Gauguin penned letters to his wife, Mette, lamenting the arduous conditions: \"I have to dig\u2026 from five-thirty in the morning to six in the evening, under the tropical sun and rain,\" he wrote. [...] Meanwhile, Laval had been earning money by drawing portraits of canal officials, work which Gauguin detested since only portraits done in a lewd manner would sell. [...] At the time, France had a policy of repatriation where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. [...] While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of Indian immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. [...] During his stay, the writer Lafcadio Hearn was also on the island. [...] His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin's images. [...] His letters to Schuffenecker express an excitement about the exotic location and natives represented in his paintings. [...] He recycled some of his figures and sketches in later paintings, such as the motif in Among the Mangoes, which is replicated on his fans. [...] At the same time, Vincent and Gauguin became close friends (on Vincent's part it amounted to something akin to adulation) and they corresponded together on art, a correspondence that was instrumental in Gauguin formulating his philosophy of art . [...] He wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and handed it to a woman who worked at a brothel Gauguin and Vincent had both visited, and asked her to \"keep this object carefully, in remembrance of me\". [...] Although Gauguin made some of his early strides in the world of art under Pissarro, Edgar Degas was Gauguin's most admired contemporary artist and a great influence on his work from the beginning, with his figures and interiors as well as a carved and painted medallion of singer Val\u00e9rie Roumi. [...] It was Gauguin's healthiest, longest-lasting friendship, spanning his entire artistic career until his death. [...] Gauguin's late canvas Riders on the Beach (two versions) recalls Degas' horse pictures that he started in the 1860s, specifically Racetrack and Before the Race, testifying to his enduring effect on Gauguin. [...] His avowed intent was to escape European civilization and \"everything that is artificial and conventional\". [...] Nevertheless, he took care to take with him a collection of visual stimuli in the form of photographs, drawings and prints. [...] He spent the first three months in Papeete, the capital of the colony and already much influenced by French and European culture. [...] The painting is notable for the care with which it delineates Polynesian features. [...] Because these accounts contained no illustrations and the Tahitian models had in any case long disappeared, he could give free rein to his imagination. [...] He executed some twenty paintings and a dozen woodcarvings over the next year. [...] He had in any case largely run out of funds, depending on a state grant for a free passage home. [...] In addition he had some health problems diagnosed as heart problems by the local doctor, which Mathews suggests may have been the early signs of cardiovascular syphilis . [...] Gauguin later wrote a travelogue (first published 1901) titled Noa Noa \u00a0], originally conceived as commentary on his paintings and describing his experiences in Tahiti. [...] This was Teha'amana, called Tehura in the travelogue, who was pregnant by him by the end of summer 1892. [...] Teha'amana was the subject of several of Gauguin's paintings, including Merahi metua no Tehamana and the celebrated Spirit of the Dead Watching, as well as a notable woodcarving Tehura now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay . [...] A digital catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the paintings from this period was released by the Wildenstein Plattner Institute in 2021. [...] He affected an exotic persona, dressing in Polynesian costume, and conducted a public affair with a young woman still in her teens, \"half Indian, half Malayan\", known as Annah the Javanese \u00a0]. [...] Mathews characterises this as a tragedy for Gauguin's career. [...] Amongst other things he lost the chance of an introduction to the American market. [...] He submitted a large ceramic sculpture he called Oviri he had fired the previous winter to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April. [...] In any case, Gauguin took the opportunity to increase his public exposure by writing an outraged letter on the state of modern ceramics to Le Soir . [...] By this time it had become clear that he and his wife Mette were irrevocably separated. [...] He maintained a horse and trap, so was in a position to travel daily to Papeete to participate in the social life of the colony should he wish. [...] He subscribed to the Mercure de France (indeed was a shareholder), by then France's foremost critical journal, and kept up an active correspondence with fellow artists, dealers, critics, and patrons in Paris. [...] During his year in Papeete and thereafter, he played an increasing role in local politics, contributing abrasively to a local journal opposed to the colonial government, Les Gu\u00eapes (The Wasps), that had recently been formed, and eventually edited his own monthly publication Le Sourire: Journal s\u00e9rieux (The Smile: A Serious Newspaper), later titled simply Journal m\u00e9chant (A Wicked Newspaper). [...] In February 1900 he became the editor of Les Gu\u00eapes itself, for which he drew a salary, and he continued as editor until he left Tahiti in September 1901. [...] The paper under his editorship was noted for its scurrilous attacks on the governor and officialdom in general, but was not in fact a champion of native causes, although perceived as such nevertheless. [...] Few of his wooden carvings from this period survive, most of them collected by Monfreid. [...] The cylinder may have been inspired by similar symbolic carvings in Brittany, such as at Pleumeur-Bodou, where ancient menhirs have been Christianised by local craftsmen. [...] While he was in France, he had his ankle shattered in a drunken brawl on a seaside visit to Concarneau . [...] Gauguin blamed the tropical climate and described the sores as \"eczema\", but his biographers agree this must have been the progress of syphilis. [...] This was also the month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. [...] The painting was exhibited at Vollard's gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July. [...] Gauguin had nurtured his plan of settling in the Marquesas ever since seeing a collection of intricately carved Marquesan bowls and weapons in Papeete during his first months in Tahiti. [...] This was the administrative capital of the island group, but considerably less developed than Papeete although there was an efficient and regular steamer service between the two. [...] The doctor was relocated to Papeete the following February and thereafter Gauguin had to rely on the island's two health care workers, the Vietnamese exile Nguyen Van Cam (Ky Dong), who had settled on the island but had no formal medical training, and the Protestant pastor Paul Vernier, who had studied medicine in addition to theology. [...] He bought a plot of land in the center of the town from the Catholic mission, having first ingratiated himself with the local bishop by attending mass regularly. [...] This bishop was Monseigneur Joseph Martin, initially well disposed to Gauguin because he was aware that Gauguin had sided with the Catholic party in Tahiti in his journalism. [...] He was helped in the task by the two best Marquesan carpenters on the island, one of them called Tioka, tattooed from head to toe in the traditional Marquesan way (a tradition suppressed by the missionaries). [...] Tioka was a deacon in Vernier's congregation and became Gauguin's neighbour after the cyclone when Gauguin gifted him a corner of his plot. [...] The door to the top floor was decorated with a polychrome wood-carved lintel and jambs that still survive in museums. [...] House of Pleasure), while the jambs echoed his earlier 1889 wood-carving Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (i.e. [...] In the early days at least, until Gauguin found a vahine, the house drew appreciative crowds in the evenings from the natives, who came to stare at the pictures and party half the night away. [...] The schools continued with difficulty as private institutions, but these difficulties were compounded when Gauguin established that attendance at any given school was only compulsory within a catchment area of some two and a half miles radius. [...] This led to numerous teenage daughters being withdrawn from the schools (Gauguin called this process \"rescuing\"). [...] He took as vahine one such girl, Vaeoho (also called Marie-Rose), the 14-year-old daughter of a native couple who lived in an adjoining valley six miles distant. [...] This can scarcely have been a pleasant task for her as Gauguin's sores were by then extremely noxious and required daily dressing. [...] By November he had settled into his new home with Vaeoho, a cook (Kahui), two other servants (nephews of Tioka), his dog, Pegau (a play on his initials PG), and a cat. [...] The partying ceased and he began a period of productive work, sending twenty canvases to Vollard the following April. [...] The world is so stupid that if one shows it canvases containing new and terrible elements, Tahiti will become comprehensible and charming. [...] My Brittany pictures are now rose-water because of Tahiti; Tahiti will become eau de Cologne because of the Marquesas. [...] In fact, his Marquesas work for the most part can only be distinguished from his Tahiti work by experts or by their dates, paintings such as Two Women remaining uncertain in their location. [...] Gauguin chose to paint landscapes, still lifes, and figure studies at this time, with an eye to Vollard's clientele, avoiding the primitive and lost paradise themes of his Tahiti paintings. [...] But there is a significant trio of pictures from this last period that suggest deeper concerns. [...] Le Sorcier appears to have been executed at the same time and depicts a long-haired young man wearing an exotic red cape. [...] The androgynous nature of the image has attracted critical attention, giving rise to speculation that Gauguin intended to depict a m\u0101h\u016b (i.e. [...] The pain in his injured ankle grew insupportable and in July he was obliged to order a trap from Papeete so that he could get about town. [...] The local gendarme, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charpillet, at first friendly to Gauguin, wrote a report to the administrator of the island group, who resided on the neighbouring island of Nuku Hiva, criticizing Gauguin for encouraging natives to withdraw their children from school as well as encouraging settlers to withhold payment of their taxes. [...] Nevertheless, its publication inspired him to consider writing other books. [...] Gauguin returned the book with critical remarks he later published in his autobiographical reminisces. [...] He next prepared a witty and well-documented essay, Racontars de Rapin (Tales of a Dabbler) on critics and art criticism, which he sent for publication to Andr\u00e9 Fontainas, art critic at the Mercure de France whose favourable review of Where Do We Come From? [...] He followed this with a private letter to the head of the gendarmerie in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet's excesses in making prisoners labor for him. [...] As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme, Jean-Paul Claverie, from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there. [...] His health further deteriorated in December to the extent that he was scarcely able to paint. [...] He began an autobiographical memoir he called Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After) (published in translation in the US as Intimate Journals), which he completed over the next two months. [...] He included in it attacks on subjects as diverse as the local gendarmerie, Bishop Martin, his wife Mette and the Danes in general, and concluded with a description of his personal philosophy conceiving life as an existential struggle to reconcile opposing binaries. [...] He sent the manuscript to Fontainas for editing, but the rights reverted to Mette after Gauguin's death, and it was not published until 1918 (in a facsimile edition); the American translation appearing in 1921. [...] At the beginning of 1903, Gauguin engaged in a campaign designed to expose the incompetence of the island's gendarmes, in particular Jean-Paul Claverie, for taking the side of the natives directly in a case involving the alleged drunkenness of a group of them. [...] Claverie, however, escaped censure. [...] He was subsequently fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the local magistrate on 27 March 1903. [...] In 1973, a bronze cast of his Oviri figure was placed on his grave, as he had indicated was his wish. [...] Ironically, his nearest neighbor in the cemetery is Bishop Martin, his grave surmounted by a large white cross. [...] The Paul Gauguin Cultural Center at Atuona has a reconstruction of the Maison du Jouir. [...] The original house stood empty for a few years, the door still carrying Gauguin's carved lintel. [...] This was eventually recovered, four of the five pieces held at the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay and the fifth at the Paul Gauguin Museum in Tahiti. [...] His son, \u00c9mile Gauguin, worked as a construction engineer in the U.S. and is buried in Lemon Bay Historical Cemetery, in Florida. [...] Another son, Jean Ren\u00e9, became a well-known sculptor and a staunch socialist. [...] Pola (Paul Rollon) became an artist and art critic and wrote a memoir, My Father, Paul Gauguin (1937). [...] Emile Marae a Tai, illiterate and raised in Tahiti by Pau'ura, was brought to Chicago in 1963 by the French journalist Josette Giraud and was an artist in his own right, his descendants still living in Tahiti as of 2001. [...] The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin. [...] The European cultural elite, discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and Native Americans for the first time, were fascinated, intrigued, and educated by the newness, wildness, and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. [...] Like Pablo Picasso in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called Primitive Art of those foreign cultures. [...] His bold, colourful, and design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art . [...] Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. [...] Later, he influenced Arthur Frank Mathews and the American Arts and Crafts movement . [...] John Rewald, recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin (1956) and an essay, Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas (included in Rewald's Studies in Post-Impressionism, 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others. [...] Gauguin's posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903, and an even larger one in 1906, had a stunning and powerful influence on the French avant-garde and in particular Pablo Picasso 's paintings. [...] In the autumn of 1906, Picasso made paintings of oversized nude women and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art . [...] Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting, and his writing as well. [...] According to Gauguin biographer, David Sweetman, Picasso, as early as 1902, became a fan of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. [...] Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. [...] After they met, Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces, and gave Picasso a first La Plume edition of Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin. [...] In addition to seeing Gauguin's work at Durrio's, Picasso also saw the work at Ambroise Vollard 's gallery where both he and Gauguin were represented. [...] Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, John Richardson wrote:  The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. [...] Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art\u2014not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides\u2014could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. [...] If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. [...] Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor. [...] Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin sculpture called Oviri (literally meaning 'savage'), the gruesome phallic figure of the Tahitian goddess of life and death that was intended for Gauguin's grave, exhibited in the 1906 retrospective exhibition that even more directly led to Les Demoiselles. [...] Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue Oviri, which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. [...] According to Richardson, Picasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne . [...] The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome Oviri. [...] Picasso was very struck by Oviri. [...] Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. [...] Gauguin's initial artistic guidance was from Pissarro, but the relationship left more of a mark personally than stylistically. [...] His own beliefs, and in some cases the psychology behind his work, were also influenced by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 . [...] Gauguin, like some of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, employed a technique for painting on canvas known as peinture \u00e0 l'essence. [...] Shortly after this, he also made his breakthroughs in non-representational colour, creating canvases that had an independent existence and vitality all their own. [...] This complemented one of Gauguin's favorite themes, which was the intrusion of the supernatural into day-to-day life, in one instance going so far as to recall ancient Egyptian tomb reliefs with Her Name is Vairaumati and Ta Matete. [...] In an interview with L'\u00c9cho de Paris published on 15 March 1895, Gauguin explains that his developing tactical approach is reaching for synesthesia . [...] He states:\n In an 1888 letter to Schuffenecker, Gauguin explains the enormous step he had taken away from Impressionism and that he was now intent on capturing the soul of nature, the ancient truths and character of its scenery and inhabitants. [...] Gauguin was not hindered by his printing inexperience, and made a number of provocative and unorthodox choices, such as a zinc plate instead of limestone (lithography ), wide margins and large sheets of yellow poster paper. [...] They were shown again at a small show in his studio in 1894, where he garnered rare critical praise for his exceptional painterly and sculptural effects. [...] Gauguin's emerging preference for the woodcut was not only a natural extension of his wood reliefs and sculpture, but may have also been provoked by its historical significance to medieval artisans and the Japanese. [...] Gauguin's series is starkly unified with black and white aesthetic and may have intended the prints to be similar to a set of myriorama cards, in which they may be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes. [...] In 1899 he started his radical experiment: oil transfer drawings. [...] The transfers were the grand culmination of his quest for an aesthetic of primordial suggestion, which seems to be relayed in his results that echo ancient rubbings, worn frescos and cave paintings. [...] Gauguin's technical progress from monotyping to the oil transfers is quite noticeable, advancing from small sketches to ambitiously large, highly finished sheets. [...] His process, nearly alchemical in nature, had elements of chance by which unexpected marks and textures regularly arose, something that fascinated him. [...] In metamorphosing a drawing into a print, Gauguin made a calculated decision of relinquishing legibility in order to gain mystery and abstraction. [...] He worked in wood throughout his career, particularly during his most prolific periods, and is known for having achieved radical carving results before doing so with painting. [...] Even in his earliest shows, Gauguin often included wood sculpture in his display, from which he built his reputation as a connoisseur of the so-called primitive. [...] A number of his early carvings appear to be influenced by Gothic and Egyptian art . [...] In correspondence, he also asserts a passion for Cambodian art and the masterful colouring of Persian carpet and Oriental rug . [...]  became the world's third-most expensive artwork when its owner, the family of Rudolf Staechelin, sold it privately for US$210\u00a0million in September 2014. [...] The Japanese styled Gauguin Museum, opposite the Botanical Gardens of Papeari in Papeari, Tahiti, contains some exhibits, documents, photographs, reproductions and original sketches and block prints of Gauguin and Tahitians. [...] In 2003, the Paul Gauguin Cultural Center opened in Atuona in the Marquesas Islands . [...] For a comprehensive list of paintings by Gauguin, see List of paintings by Paul Gauguin ."

[...] He was the youngest child of Danish silversmith and designer Georg Arthur Jensen (1866\u20131935) and his wife Magdalene Hanna Agnes Christiansen (1888\u20131966). [...] Ib Georg Jensen trained as a potter at Herman A. K\u00e4hler ceramics in 1947, and followed much in his father's footsteps, opening his own pottery shop, Muk Pottery, adopted from a childhood pseudonym, in 1949. [...] Later on he would work for the Georg Jensen Silversmithy for a brief period of time and later move on to Gero in the Netherlands where he would design their modern style of flatware and cutlery. [...] His vast experience with pottery has led him to write a number of books on the subject, including \"Pottemagerens h\u00e5ndbog\" (The ceramists handbook) and on the subject of his father, \"Der var engang en s\u00f8lvsmed\u00a0\u2013 Historien om min far Georg Jensen\" (Once there were a silversmith\u00a0\u2013 the story of my father). [...] In 2004 he had helped to organize the exhibition \u201cThe Unknown Georg Jensen\u201d and was involved in the previous signature dispute with the Georg Jensen Silversmithy. [...] Ib Georg Jensen's primary dispute with the firm has been primarily a heartfelt concern about his father's image and rich history, and he has desired to uphold the Georg Jensen name and the quality and artistic beauty. [...] He has also been known to state his distress at the Georg Jensen name being attached to \u201call sorts of small items\u201d and odd items not affiliated with his father's work. [...] The dispute with Georg Jensen Silversmithy resulted in a mutual understanding and respect which lasted and with the dispute behind him, he remained happy and cheerful with his own family and his memories and continued his quest to promote his father's work through \u201cThe Georg Jensen Society\u201d, a group that is unaffiliated with the Silversmithy and founded in 2000, as well as the \u201cGeorg Jensen Magazine\u201d. [...] His work was exhibited in 2008 at Designmuseum Danmark in Copenhagen, Denmark and again in 2016 at Sophienholm, an exhibition hall in Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k outside Copenhagen, as part of the \u201cGEORG JENSEN \u2013 150 \u00c5R\u201d (Georg Jensen - 150 years).

[...] While this was a form debuted by Kazuo Yagi and the other members of S\u014ddeisha, including Yagi, the latter expressed that he was never particularly convinced by the term, feeling that there was a lot of confusion surrounding its meaning for both critics and the casual viewer, and that a lot of meaning became lost in its translation, resulting in a conception of S\u014ddeisha pottery that was more generalized than the sensibilities with which the artists sought to imbue their work."

Beazley to the Andokides Painter, a name derived from the potter Andokides, whose signature appears on several of the vases bearing the painter's work. [...] Several details regarding the artistic biography of the Andokides Painter have been suggested through connoisseurial studies of his work. [...] Dietrich von Bothmer also notes that the earliest instances of the use of a white ground in vase painting occur in the Andokides Painter's scenes, perhaps indicating that he should be credited additionally with inventing the white ground technique. [...] The evidence for this date lies in the connections between the Andokides Painter's work and a datable monument: the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi . [...] The frieze of the Treasury shows certain stylistic and compositional innovations, such as the introduction of three-quarter views and foreshortening, which parallel developments in the new red-figure painting, most especially in images by the Andokides Painter. [...] Additionally, certain subjects depicted on the Treasury, like the struggle for the Delphic tripod, are not generally found in Attic painting until the Andokides Painter's red-figure scenes. [...] The relationship between the Treasury and the Andokides Painter's work is so strong, that some scholars have posited the vase painter was somehow involved in the frieze's production, perhaps as a colorist. [...] The Andokides Painter has always featured prominently in scholarly debates over the attribution of bilingual vases. [...] Beazley changed his mind over the matter several times during his career, specifically in relation to works he attributed to the Andokides Painter. [...] He eventually came to the conclusion that two artists were involved in production of the vases, the Andokides Painter painted the red-figure pictures and another artist, who he named the Lysippides Painter, produced the black-figure pictures. [...] Many scholars, however, have resisted this conclusion and question whether the Andokides Painter and the Lysippides Painter are in fact one and the same. [...] Her conclusions demonstrated that the Lysippides Painter and the Andokides Painter were distinct, that shared details among the paintings were the result of collaboration, and that the black-figure images were a self-contained corpus that was not produced by the painter of the red-figure scenes. [...] Elizabeth Simpson in her article \"The Andokides Painter and Greek Carpentry\" further settled the debate by demonstrating a key difference between the painters of the red-figure and black-figure images on vase Munich 2301. [...] In the red-figure painting, details of the couch indicate the Andokides Painter had a thorough working knowledge of carpentry practices: tenons and rails are accurately depicted, conforming to woodworking practices and known ancient forms."
